The aim of this project was to create a microservice focused on the reviewing process of scientific papers throughout several phases of a conference. The team had 5 members and after our microservice was completed, we needed to integrate it with the microservices of other teams. A lot of focus was given towards Domain Driven Design (DDD) and proper testing.
